# app-web2f
First attempt at a PHP5 CMS from 2007-2008. Here for possible reference.

## Information
The entire framework is based around a hack I came up with that everything is a module that can be overloaded based on precedence (which loaded last).  

It was a moderately bad attempt, and has no concept of MVC or HMVC.
