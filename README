First attempt at a PHP 5 CMS from a couple years ago. Proceed with caution. I may use it for personal sites and update it as I go along. Maybe.

== Information

The entire framework is based around a hack I came up with that everything is a module that can be overloaded based on precedence (which loaded last).

All of the pages are stored in SQL, which was beneficial to begin with, but difficult to update.

It was a pretty bad attempt.
